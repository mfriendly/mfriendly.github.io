Agenda
 Similarity and distance
 Nearest Neighborhood Inference
 Clustering
• Hierarchical clustering
• K-Means clustering
 Practice
• [For reference] 6-1. Iris k-NN classification
• 6-2. Analysis of which vehicle models newly developed vehicles are most similar to
(k-NN classification)
• 6-3. Telecommunication company customer cluster analysis (k-Means)
• [For reference] 6-4. After cluster analysis, cluster assignment for new data

Similarity and Clusters
 Assume that if some aspects are similar, other characteristics are often the same.
Below, the correct way to group objects or judge similarity using similarity is
work to find criteria
 Similarity, Neighbors, Clusters
• Similarity: Find other customers who are similar to your best customers to find prospects in your business.
IBM finds other companies similar to its top customers to find potential customers in its sales department.
- Advertising companies try to show online advertisements to customers similar to their current best customers
• Neighborhood: Companies such as Amazon and Netflix have similar products
A feature that recommends products or recommends products purchased by similar people.

6.1 Similarity and Distance
 The object is expressed as a feature vector,
The closer two objects are in space, the more similar they are.
Well
 Euclidean distance
• If an object has two features, it is represented as a point in a two-dimensional space.
• The distance between two points is the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
The square root of the sum of the square of the width and the square of the height by

6.1 Similarity and Distance
 Multidimensional Euclidean distance
• It is not limited to two dimensions, and as the dimension increases, it is possible to add any number of features.
• Universal Euclidean distance
• The distance obtained is only a number and cannot be interpreted meaningfully because it has no unit.
• The similarity of one pair can be compared with the similarity of another pair, and the comparison alone is of great help.

Handling of categorical variables
 Rank-type sequence variable (Ordinal: bad, average, good)
• If the values ​​of a categorical variable have a rank (ranked sequence variable), they are converted to a continuous variable.
also considered
• Problems can arise when the number of categories is small, but can be applied in many cases
 Nominal Nominal Variables (Nominal: male, female)
• Sometimes used by changing the category to a binary variable: Dummy variable (1: true, 0: false)
• For example, the educational attainment variable with the values ​​'high school', 'university', and 'graduate school' has three
Can be represented as a binary variable
High School (X0): Yes/No => 0, 1
University (X1): Yes/No => 0, 1
Graduate (X2): Yes/No => 0, 1
• In the above example, it should be noted that if two variable values ​​are known, the third variable value is
Because it is automatically determined, only two variables are used when building the model. Regression and logistic
In the case of regression analysis, if all three variables are used, the model itself is not built.

Nominal variable (Dummy variable)
 Nominal variable
• Preprocessing is required for nominal variables such as gender, educational background, and region.
• X (educational) variable => X1 (university), X2 (graduate school): X0 (high school) is the standard

6.3 Similarity, Key to Neighborhood
Detail
 Heterogeneous properties
• Classification (symbol) attributes such as gender must be converted to numeric
Example: Male=0, Female=1
• Numerical variables with different scales and ranges require normalization
Example: Age is 18-100, but income can be 100-10 billion . 10 years difference and 10 won difference in income
There is a problem if the cases are treated in the same way -> Need to adjust the scale of the variable value

6.3.2 Other distance functions
 Euclidean distance (L2-norm)
• Most commonly used because it is easy to understand and quick to calculate.
 Manhattan Street (L1-norm)
• Sum of distances in each dimension
• The sum of the north-south and east-west travel distances of a grid-type street in Manhattan, New York.
 Jacquard Street
• Treat two objects as feature sets
• Jacquard distance is proportional to all features shared by the two objects

6.3.2 Other distance functions
 cosine distance
• When classifying text to measure the similarity of two documents, the cosine distance is
species used
• Cosine similarity is 1-cosine distance
• Used to ignore the size difference between objects
 Edit Distance or
Levenshtein Distance
• A metric to determine how similar two text fields are.
• It is necessary to convert one string to another by inserting, deleting, or replacing characters.
Calculate the minimum number of edit operations required
